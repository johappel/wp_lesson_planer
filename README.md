# WP Lesson Planer Documentation

## Overview
WP Lesson Planer is a WordPress plugin designed to assist teachers in lesson planning through an intelligent, self-learning system. It combines structured content creation with AI-powered suggestions and community features.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Lesson Planning Framework
The plugin uses a standardized markdown-based template for lesson planning:
- General Information (context, grade level, time requirements)
- Everyday Experiences (student-relevant scenarios)
- Challenges (learning objectives and hurdles)
- Competencies (skills to be developed)
- Methods (teaching approaches)
- Related Topics (cross-references)
- Resources (materials and references)

### 2. Self-Learning System
The plugin learns from user interactions and successful lesson plans:
- Pattern Recognition: Identifies successful teaching sequences
- Usage Analysis: Tracks which combinations work best
- Feedback Processing: Incorporates teacher and student feedback
- Continuous Optimization: Improves suggestions over time

### 3. Content Sources
Content is gathered from multiple sources:
- Manual Teacher Input: Direct content creation
- Community Contributions: Shared lesson plans and resources
- Automated Scraping: Content from educational websites
- AI Processing: Generated and enhanced content

### 4. Regional Integration
Supports regional educational requirements:
- Curriculum Mapping: Links to official curricula
- Regional Content: Location-specific resources
- Language Support: Multi-language capability
- Cultural Context: Regional teaching approaches
